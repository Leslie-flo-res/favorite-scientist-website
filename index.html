              American astronaut and administrator who was the first Hispanic

          Ochoa studied electrical engineering at Stanford University, earning a
          master’s degree (1981) and a doctorate (1985). A specialist in the
          development of optical systems, she worked as a research engineer at
          Sandia National Laboratories and at the Ames Research Center of the
          National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). She helped
          create several systems and methods that were awarded patents,
          including optical systems for the detection of imperfections in a
          repeating pattern and for the recognition of objects.Ochoa was
          selected by NASA in 1990 to participate in its astronaut program, and
          she became the first Hispanic female astronaut when she completed her
          training in 1991. In April 1993 she served as mission specialist
          aboard the STS-56 mission of the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the
          first Latina to be launched into space. During this mission, she and
          the other mission specialists performed various experiments
          collectively called ATLAS-2 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications
          and Science-2) that studied the Sun and its interaction with Earth’s
          atmosphere.

              Shuttle Discovery in 1993. She flew a total of 4 missions, serving
              as the flight engineer (during launch, rendezvous and entry phases
              of each mission), as robotic arm operator and as lead for science
              experiments. In total, she spent nearly 1,000 hours in space from
              1993 to 2002.In 2013, Ellen Ochoa became the 11th director of the
              NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. She was the second female to
              hold this prestigious position, and the first Latina. She guided
              more than 10,000 civil servants and contractors at the NASA
              Johnson Space Center to adopt a lean, agile, adaptive-to-change
              approach to advancing human space exploration, while also
              launching initiatives designed to expand diversity and inclusion.
